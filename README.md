# A landing page holding all projects I have worked on over the years.

The goal of creating this project was an opportunity to use ReactJS with ThreeJS. More specifically, with the use of React-Three-Fiber, I was able to create interactive views with 3D models.

The space theme of the app was chosen from my love of the subject of space. 

You can visit it [here](https://georgecodehub.github.io/portfolio/).

### Tech Stack

Front-end: ReactJS, Typescript, React-Three-Fiber

Back-end: Django, PostgreSQL
